# Win10-Cleanup-Script
Powershell script to clean a fresh win10 installation, will nuke everything of that kind that can be removed. Don't just run it, comment out anything you want to keep (calculator springs to mind as an obvious one). The start menu will require some manual cleanup afterwards, though I'm sure this can be autod too.
